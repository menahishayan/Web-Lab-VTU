Web Lab programs for VTU 15CSL77 17CSL77 18CSL77

Programs 8 and 10 are not worth the time. Just ignore them.

To run program 10:
 - install mysql (and xampp/apache or other web server)
 - run createDB.php
 - run createTable.php
 - run p10.php
Make sure the SQL url, username and password are set up correctly. SQL and DB settings must be done either via the sql terminal command or a frontend like phpmyadmin.
